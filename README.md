# 🧾 React Spreadsheet Clone – Internship Assignment

This is a front-end-only React + TypeScript web application that mimics a spreadsheet-style table, built as part of the Inscripts Internship Assignment. The interface is inspired by tools like Google Sheets, with editable cells, filtering, and a clean toolbar layout.

  - Status (e.g. In-process, Blocked, Complete)
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
  - Submitted After (date picker)
- ✅ Toggleable filter panel
- ✅ Spreadsheet-like layout with responsive UI
- ✅ Conditional styling on cells (e.g. priority/status colors)
- ✅ Toolbar with action buttons (console logged)
- ✅ ESLint + Prettier for clean code formatting

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** (with TypeScript)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **React Table** (lightweight table engine)
- **ESLint + Prettier** (code quality + formatting)
- **Vercel** (for deployment)
